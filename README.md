## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <>
cd todo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Environment Setup

The application requires the following environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Database Schema

The Supabase database uses the following schema for todos:

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (

  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);


ALTER TABLE todos DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
